Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, I have created a program that takes an input keyword, then scrapes the Google Trends data, 
first from the entire 2004-present timeline, which only has a resolution of one data point per month. 
Then, the program finds the top 5 most prominent peaks in that data set. The program then drills down 
into the peaks, and gathers the data for that specific month to find the specific day of the peak. The program then returns the top 5 most prominent days of interest for that keyword.

I have written a seperate function that takes an input keyword and searches the top 5 news articles about that keyword on a given day.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Basically, what I have to do now is combine these two programs, to create one program that takes a keyword, returns the five most prominent days in that things internet life, then returns both the five dates, and a news article to summarize what might have caused that peak. If I have the time and ability, I might make a GUI that displays the graph, and shows each point along with the news article to create a summary of all the data.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Learning more effectively how to import libraries and deal with other new data types like matrices and multi axis arrays has been confusing and difficult, but manageable.
