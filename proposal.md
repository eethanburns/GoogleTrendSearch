# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Google Trend Peak Search

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program to take Google Trends data, and return a hopefully accurate summary of the most prominent points based on news articles.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The program will take one input, a simple search keyword. This could be a person, ("Elon Musk", "Kanye", "Joe Biden"), a piece of media ("Succession", "Batman", "Sesame Street") or even a general concept, ("Bitcoin", "inflation", "Video games") and return a summary of that keyword's most culturally prominent days on the internet, and the reasons for those peaks in cultural relevance. I will do this by taking Google Trends data, which serves as a generally pretty fantastic indicator of something's relevance to the public conciousness over time, and also Google's news search tools to find news articles related to something on a specific day. Along with a tool to find peaks in a graph, the combination of all these smaller pieces should leave me with a complete useful tool.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, the program will display in text a set of dates and news articles from those dates related to a keyword. The dates will be based off the times at which that keyword peaked the highest on Google Trends.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Some sort of graphic interface to interact with the data the program finds would be fantastic. I'm imagining a mousable graph, similar to what already exists on Google Trends, but with icons or popups that can be clicked to show the news articles related to peaks on the graph.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Perhaps this could be integrated into a web interface to be easily used without installing or using any command line? This seems a little bit outside of my comfort level, so we'll see. Anything is possible!

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to figure out the basics of scraping data from the internet, specifically from Google Trends and Google News. Is this process similar to when importing data from text files? Is it multistep, where I would download a file then read from that file? What does the process look like? Otherwise I think I have most of the other skills I need to make it a reality.
