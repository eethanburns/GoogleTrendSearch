# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I want to create a tool that takes data from the internet and parses it in some way.
I'd originally imagined something related to reddit's r/place project? But that might be biting off more than I could chew
I also have some ideas related to using Google Trends data, but I don't know exactly what I could do with that.


TODO

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
I'm working alone.

TODO

## Do you have any questions of your own?
I'm not sure exactly how uploading a project that imports libraries that aren't included in Python works.
