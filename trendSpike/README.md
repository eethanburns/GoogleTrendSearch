Google Trends Highlight Search
Ethan Burns
for CIS 1050 Intro to Python

USE INSTRUCTIONS

To use, open runGUI.py

Input search term, in text box.
Works best with popular people, shows, movies, companies, etc, words with good SEO / recognisability

Select sort order, Chronolocigal for Highlights put in time order, or Popularity for prominence order

Select number of Peaks to detect, aka number of highlights to search for
Most trends graphs don't have more than 5 prominent graphs, but adding more just means longer search time

Select number of Article headlines to find for each Peaks
Articles are always sorted by Google's default search sorting algorithm (which tends to work quite well, hence Google's success) so more than 5 usually doesn't do much to add to the data, but again, more articles just increases search time

Press search, then wait as results populate in command line.

Once results are done populating, another search can be done without closing or reloading.

CHALLENGES
This project taught me lots about dealing with large data sets, as well as scraping data from the internet. When I originally began, I wanted to have a more flashy graphical display for the data, and I did make a few attempts at this throughout the process, but this proved to be too much of a roadblock to overcome, so I ended up with a much simpler text based alternative. I do think however, that this still does a great job of giving the usefullness I had hoped from the beginning to deliver.

One of the major segments of the coding process for me was learning how to deal with 3rd party libraries such as pandas and numpy, not to mention Google search and GoogleNews. Those scraping tools give much of their information in dataframe form, which was a new form of variable that I had zero experience in using. A huge part of my coding time was spent learning to manage those.
